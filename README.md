## Problem Statement
### Background of the problem ​
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, resulting in high medical costs and significant loss of life. For healthcare providers and insurers, this leads to increased hospitalization costs, resource strain, and economic burdens.​
### Why is it important? ​
By identifying high-risk patients in advance, healthcare organizations can better allocate resources, reduce treatment costs, and ultimately improve the quality of life for patients proactively​
### Objectives of the project​
Objective is to create a reliable ML model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical history, and factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes status, obesity (high BMI), physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption.​
### How can Data Science solve the problem?​
Data science helps us in processing the historical data available to us and develop a reliable ML model which can be used by healthcare providers/patients/insurers to better assess the patient for heart disease


## Data Set 
[Indicators of Heart Disease (2022 UPDATE) (kaggle.com)​](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)

The dataset originally comes from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to collect data on the health status of U.S. residents​

### Description of the data (features, size, format) ​
##### Format
csv​

##### Size
- A version of the file with missing data (NaNs): 445,132 rows. = 139.87MB​
- A version of the file without missing data (NaNs): 246,022 rows. = 81.98 MB​

##### Features
There are 40 features available in dataset including PhysicalActivities, SleepHours, HadStroke, etc
a summary of your dataset, etc.
